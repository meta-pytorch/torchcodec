Decoding audio streams with AudioDecoder
========================================

In this example, we'll learn how to decode an audio file using the
:class:`~torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder` class.

# %%
# First, a bit of boilerplate: we'll download an audio file from the web and
# define an audio playing utility.  You can ignore that part and jump right
# below to :ref:`creating_decoder_audio`.

#
# Creating a decoder
# ------------------
#
# We can now create a decoder from the raw (encoded) audio bytes. You can of
# course use a local audio file and pass the path as input. You can also decode
# audio streams from videos!

from torchcodec.decoders import AudioDecoder

decoder = AudioDecoder(raw_audio_bytes)

# %%
# The has not yet been decoded by the decoder, but we already have access to
# some metadata via the ``metadata`` attribute which is an
# :class:`~torchcodec.decoders.AudioStreamMetadata` object.
print(decoder.metadata)

# %%
# Decoding samples
# ----------------
#
# To get decoded samples, we just need to call the
# :meth:`~torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder.get_samples_played_in_range` method,
# which returns an :class:`~torchcodec.AudioSamples` object:

samples = decoder.get_samples_played_in_range()

print(samples)
play_audio(samples)

# %%
# The ``.data`` field is a tensor of shape ``(num_channels, num_samples)`` and
# of float dtype with values in [-1, 1].
#
# The ``.pts_seconds`` field indicates the starting time of the output samples.
# Here it's 0.025 seconds, even though we asked for samples starting from 0. Not
# all streams start exactly at 0! This is not a bug in TorchCodec, this is a
# property of the file that was defined when it was encoded.
#
# %%
# Specifying a range
# ------------------
#
# By default,
# :meth:`~torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder.get_samples_played_in_range`  decodes
# the entire audio stream, but we can specify a custom range:

samples = decoder.get_samples_played_in_range(start_seconds=10, stop_seconds=70)

print(samples)
play_audio(samples)

# %%
# Custom sample rate
# ------------------
#
# We can also decode the samples into a desired sample rate using the
# ``sample_rate`` parameter of :class:`~torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder`. The
# ouput will sound the same, but note that the number of samples greatly
# increased:

decoder = AudioDecoder(raw_audio_bytes, sample_rate=16_000)
samples = decoder.get_samples_played_in_range(start_seconds=0)

print(samples)
play_audio(samples)
