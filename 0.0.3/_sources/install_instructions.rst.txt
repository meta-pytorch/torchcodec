Installation Instructions
=========================

.. note::
    TorchCodec is only available on Linux for now. We plan to support other
    platforms in the future.

Installing torchcodec should be as simple as:

.. code:: bash

    pip install torchcodec

You will need a working PyTorch installation, which you can install following
the `official instructions <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_.

You will also need FFmpeg installed on your system, and TorchCodec decoding
capabilities are determined by your underlying FFmpeg installation. There are
different options to install FFmpeg e.g.:

.. code:: bash

    conda install ffmpeg
    # or
    conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge

Your Linux distribution probably comes with FFmpeg pre-installed as well.
TorchCodec supports all major FFmpeg version in [4, 7].

Note that installation instructions may slightly change over time. The most
up-to-date instructions should be available from the `README
<https://github.com/pytorch/torchcodec?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-torchcodec>`_.
