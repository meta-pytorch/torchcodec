        "## How it works\nIn Python, a [file-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object)\nis any object that exposes special methods for reading, writing and seeking.\nWhile such methods are obviously file oriented, it's not required that\na file-like object is backed by an actual file. As far as Python is concerned,\nif an object acts like a file, it's a file. This is a powerful concept, as\nit enables libraries that read or write data to assume a file-like interface.\nOther libraries that present novel resources can then be easily used by\nproviding a file-like wrapper for their resource.\n\nFor our case, we only need the read and seek methods for decoding. The exact\nmethod signature needed is in the example below. Rather than wrap a novel\nresource, we demonstrate this capability by wrapping an actual file while\ncounting how often each method is called.\n\n"

The answer is that in our decoder implementation, we're\nactually calling a special\n[FFmpeg function](https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/6.1/group__lavf__decoding.html#gad42172e27cddafb81096939783b157bb)\nthat decodes the first few frames to return more robust metadata.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Python file-like interface is only half of\nthe story.
