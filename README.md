# TorchCodec

TorchCodec is a Python package with a goal to provide useful and fast APIs to
decode video frames to PyTorch Tensors.

⚠️ TorchCodec is still in early development stage and we are actively seeking
feedback. If you have any suggestions or issues, please let us know by opening
an issue!

<!-- TODO_UPDATE_LINK add link to issue tracker -->

## Using TorchCodec

<!-- TODO BEFORE_RELEASE: polish this example -->

```python
from torchcodec.decoders import SimpleVideoDecoder

video = SimpleVideoDecoder("/path/to/video.mp4")

# Indexing API:
first_frame = video[0]
last_frame = video[-1]

# PTS API:
frame_visible_at_2_seconds = video.get_frame_displayed_at(2)
```

For more detailed examples, check out our docs!

## Installing TorchCodec

First install the latest stable version of PyTorch following the
[official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Then:

```bash
pip install torchcodec
```

You will also need FFmpeg installed on your system, and TorchCodec decoding
capabilities are determined by your underlying FFmpeg installation. There are
different options to install FFmpeg e.g.:

```bash

    conda install ffmpeg
    # or
    conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
```

Your Linux distribution probably comes with FFmpeg pre-installed as well.
TorchCodec supports all major FFmpeg version in [4, 7].

## Planned future work

We are actively working on the following features:

<!-- TODO_UPDATE_LINK link to relevant issues-->

- MacOS support (currently, only Linux is supported)
- Nvidia GPU decoding is experimental
- Audio decoding

Let us know if you have any feature requests by opening an issue!
